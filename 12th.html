				<h3>Career Guidance</h3>
				<p>If you have completed class 12th just now, then consider taking
        computer science. We are not like other career counsellors who will tell
        you that other fields have limitless scope. No, they do not. <br> <br> If you are in
        in India, take computer science at any reputed university and study hard
        for 4 years. Participate in hackathons, do leetcode questions. Practice
       data structures and algorithms. Dilligently do competitive coding and you
       will make a rock solid living. <br> <br> We would have recommended you other options
       as well if you were not in India, but since you are, this seems to be the
       only logical choice taking into account the current job market scenario. If you have
       more questions, drop us an email anytime. We will be happy to answer your queries!</p>
