				<h3>Career Guidance</h3>
				<p>If you have completed class 10th and confused about which stream
        to choose, then worry not. <br> We have got all the roadmaps covered.
        If you score above 115 in an IQ test, then you should definitely
        consider taking science. <br> <br> Also, explore what you're interested in.
        Suppose you are not interested in science at all but you solely
        take it because you are mentally capable, then that as well is not
        a good option because it wouldn't serve you well in the long run. <br> <br>
        Industry veterans like Vaibhav recommended that you pursue only
        that thing which makes you happy and satisfied. Get a feel of all
        the options by watching related content videos at 2x speed. Have a
        brief look at the books on that subject. See what makes you curious and
        sparks your interest.</p>
